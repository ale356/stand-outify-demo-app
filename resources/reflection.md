# Reflection
This is a reflection on the chapters 2 - 11 in the book Clean Code.
## Chapter 2
This is the chapter that I think has affected me the most. Since naming is something we do very frequently as programmers for functions, variables, parameters, classes and packages. The rules in this chapter has been helpful such as "Use Intention-Revealing Names" and "Use Pronounceable Names". You can see that in the method name "changeAnimationStyle" that I have only choosed words to make it easier to pronounce. It is also quite clear what the method will do thanks to it's method name. I choose to have a comment for the method since I wanted to tell the type of the parameter.
