 ## Namngivning ( kapitel 2 )
| Name And Explaination | Reflection And Rules From Clean Code |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| <ins>initializeElement(animationstyle, childElement, eventType)</ins> - Method name of a method that initializes the custom element stand-outify with a style, event type and a child element. | <ins>Use intention revealing names</ins> - By using the verb initialize in the method name I clearly state the intention behind the method. The word element could be clearer as a second thought. Since it’s not obvious what element it is that is initialised in the method. The parameters used are clearly telling what should be inputed in terms of what. But it does not talk about what type it should be. <ins>Avoid Disinformation</ins> - As mention earlier in the method name I use the word element, and this could trick people since I don’t clearly state what element it is that should be initialised.  Maybe initializeStandoutify() would have been more appropriate. <ins>Use solution domain names</ins> - I think that the verb initialize fits the solution domain since initializing is something programmers do frequently. In java you can initialize a variable by giving it a correct start value.  
| <ins>changeAnimationStyle(animationStyle)</ins> - Method name of a method that changes the animation style. | <ins>Don’t be cute</ins> - I think that the method name is just clearly trying to explain what it does. Without trying to sound quirky or funny. There is no inside joke or random trivia that someone might not know about. <ins>Don’t add non essential text</ins> - There is no unnecessary information in the method name. It just straight up tells the reader what it does, and nothing more. 
| <ins>abortEventListenerChildElement()</ins> - Method name of a method that removes the animation from an initialized element by removing the event listener with the method abort() from the class Controller. | <ins>Use intention revealing names</ins> - I probably should have called the method removeAnimation() instead since it needs less explanation to the users of the library of what it actually does. I do however tell in the method name that is is the child element specifically that will be affected. <ins>Use searchable names</ins> - The name is however easy searchable since the word abort in the method name is unique. And the whole method name is long which makes it suitable as a public method with a large scope. 
| <ins>changeColorOfAnimation(colorString)</ins> - Method name of a method that changes the color of the animation if an animation has the property color. | <ins>Avoid encodings</ins> - In the method name I don’t specify the scope of the method. But in the parameter name I mention the type of the parameter. If it was a strongly typed language I wouldn’t have mentioned it. But since I wrote the library in JavaScript I thought it would help to understand the method. <ins>Pick one word per concept</ins> - For the concept of changing something I use the word “change” in the method names for the class/custom element stand-outify. This makes it easy to find similar methods for the programmers that will later on use the code. 
| <ins>changeDurationOfAnimation(milliseconds)</ins> - Method name of a method that changes the length in milliseconds of an animation. | <ins>Don’t Add Gratuitous Context</ins> - I don’t add any gratuitous text even though the word change is prominent in several methods. Since the word change in the method name is used for the concept of changing something regarding the animation. <ins>Use pronounceable names</ins> - In the method name I used “Of” since I thought it would make the method name more pronounceable and more clear than just “changeDurationAnimation” as a method name. |
## Reflection on chapter 2
I thought the information in chapter 2 was a good learning opportunity to become better at naming methods and functions. With the help of the different rules for naming, it became clearer and easier what one should think about. In order to create names that would be more easier to understand for other people. 

It also helped to add a depth of complexity to the naming process since the chapter brought up solution and problem domain names. It made me think more about the possibilities of creating a method name, is a more computer science term more suitable and available and if not maybe ask a domain expert and use something in that problem domain instead.

I think that naming the method “abortEventListenerChildElement” could have just been named “removeAnimation”.  I think it would have been more clear and less cluttered to go with “removeAnimation”. And it would have followed the rule “<ins>Don’t Add Gratuitous Context</ins>”.

I also think that the method name “initializeElement” could have been made more clear by following the rule “<ins>Use intention revealing names</ins>”. The method name could have been more clear regarding the last part of the name “Element” in more precisely specifying what element it is that will be initialized.

## Funktioner ( kapitel 3 )
| Method Name   | Amount of Code Rows | Reflection on Rules |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| <ins>initializeElement(animationstyle, childElement, eventType)</ins> | 26 | <ins>Small!</ins> - Since the code is 26 rows of code it violates the rule of keeping the functions small. A function should not be longer than four rows of code. <ins>Blocks and Indenting</ins> - The function violates the rule since the if statement inside the function is several lines long. Blocks inside if statements should only be one line long. <ins>Do One Thing</ins> - The function does not do only one thing since it also validates the parameters types. This validation could have been turned into its own validation method. 
| <ins>changeAnimationStyle(animationStyle)</ins> | 12 | <ins>One Level Of Abstraction per Function</ins> - The function only has one level of abstraction, even though it validates the parameter value as well. That is because the rule states that if a function does some steps that are one level below the stated name, then the function is still doing one thing. <ins>Use Descriptive Names</ins> - Since the function is relative small and only does one main thing, it was easier to choose a descriptive name. <ins>Function Arguments</ins> - The function only has one parameter therefore its monadic. 
| <ins>abortEventListenerChildElement()</ins> | 7 | <ins>Have No Side Effects</ins> - The method breaks the rule of not having side effects since it also checks if the child element exists. <ins>Prefer Exceptions to Returning Error Codes</ins> - Instead of throwing an exception inside the method, I choose to console.log an error message instead. It’s not an error code per se but similar nonetheless. <ins>Function Arguments</ins> - The function has zero parameters therefore its niladic. 
| <ins>changeColorOfAnimation(colorString)</ins> | 19 | <ins>Use Descriptive Names<ins> - The  method breaks this rule since it will only change color of animation if the current animation has the property color. <ins>Command Query Separation</ins> - The method breaks this rule since it both does something which is changing the color of the animation. But it also answers the question if the current animation has any color property. 
| <ins>changeDurationOfAnimation(milliseconds)</ins> | 14 | <ins>Don’t Repeat Yourself</ins> - When I look at the method I find that I do not repeat myself with code. <ins>Do One Thing</ins> - The method does more than one thing. Since it also validates the parameter milliseconds. This validation could have turned into a method called validateMilliseconds(milliseconds). <ins>Blocks and Indenting</ins> - The if statement inside the method consists of 3 lines of code which breaks the rule since there should at max be 1 line of code inside a block statement. |

## Reflection Overall
I have learned a lot about code quality since I started reading the book “Clean Code”. Before reading and thinking about the book, my knowledge about code quality was limited. Sure courses before have mentioned the importance of writing code that is is easy to understand and read. But that’s about it, the knowledge I had before reading the book was quite general and I hadn’t really gone in depth regarding code quality.

I think overall I made my functions to big, there were to many rows of code inside them, perhaps next time I should have trimmed these functions down If there were a possibility for it. That would have made them easier to read and understand by following the rule from chapter 3 “<ins>Small!</ins>”.

I also did not know that block statements should only have one line of code. In most of my methods there were several lines of code inside the block statements. That is following the rule “<ins>Blocks and Indenting</ins>”.

Also one important thing that I will try to think about in the future when programming is that a method should do one thing only. Following the rule “<ins>Do One Thing</ins>”. So for example next time I need to validate a parameter inside a method I can create a separate validating function instead. 


I think one thing that I will take with me from chapter 2 specifically is rule “Avoid Disinformation”. In the method name from method initializeElement(). I don’t specify exactly what element it is that will be initialised which could be confusing for someone that reads it.

I think that the other rules as well from chapter 2 will be helpful from here on as one will be more thoughtful when creating method names and perhaps revisit method names after creating them to make sure that they follow the rules mentioned in the chapter.

Before the book I still thought about making the code accessible for other programmers and myself. But the amount of new rules I learned from the book regarding naming methods. And how one should structure the code inside methods, really showed that there is always room for improvement.
